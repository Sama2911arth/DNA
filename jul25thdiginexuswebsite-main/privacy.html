            <p style="align-items: center; font-size: 18px;"> <b>Retention of Your Personal Data</b>
                The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the
                purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your Personal Data to the
                extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to
                retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal
                agreements and policies.
                The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is
                generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to

            <p style="align-items: center; font-size: 18px;"> <b>Transfer of Your Personal Data</b>
                Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating
                offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.
                It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers
                located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where
                the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.
                Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information
                represents Your agreement to that transfer.
                The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is
                treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your
                Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate
                controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.

                manage Your personal information. You may also contact Us to request access to,
                correct, or delete any personal information that You have provided to Us.

                legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.
            </p>

            <p style="align-items: center; font-size: 18px;"> <b>Business Transactions</b>
                If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data

                Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal

            <p style="align-items: center; font-size: 18px;"> <b>Security of Your Personal Data</b>
                The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
                transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While
                We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We
                cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

                Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
                personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent
                or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data,
                please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from
                anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to
                remove that information from Our servers.
                If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your
                country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before
                We collect and use that information.
            </p>
